# PowerBI
This project showcases my ability to analyze and visualize data using Power BI. I designed an interactive dashboard to uncover key insights across various dimensions, such as [data dimensions, demographics, sales performance, or regional analysis], with features like dynamic visualizations, drill-down capabilities, and real-time filtering. By leveraging advanced data modeling and calculated measures, the dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for exploring trends and enabling data-driven decision-making. This work demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through effective design and analysis.
